Hello there

To do's

create Users tab

create collaboration features
Shared Notes features:
-create a shared notes tab
    -fix the toggling of the add button when the user switches notes he wants to share (this Also connects duplication of shared notes in the database)
    -create undo
-set permissions 'view' or 'edit'
-show it in the DOM
